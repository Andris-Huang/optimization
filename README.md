# COVID-19 and QAOA
## Abstract
We used a quantum annealer to to determine how to safely reopen college campuses via quarantining students. We also implemented the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum, and showed numerically that for level 1 QAOA similar parameters are optimal on Erdos-Reyni and regular graphs.
